Welcome to **Attesta** - the future of Solana wallet authentication! We're building account abstraction on Solana using WebAuthn and passkeys, making blockchain interactions as easy and secure as unlocking your phone.

## What is Attesta?

Attesta brings **passkey-based authentication** to Solana, enabling users to:

- 🔐 **Use biometrics** instead of seed phrases (TouchID, FaceID, Windows Hello)
- 🛡️ **Stay secure** with hardware-backed private keys that never leave your device
- 🔄 **Recover easily** with multi-passkey support and social recovery
- ⚙️ **Configure policies** to control spending limits and transaction rules
- 🔒 **Maintain privacy** - biometric data never leaves your device

## Why Attesta?

Traditional cryptocurrency wallets have a fundamental UX problem: they require users to manage long seed phrases that are:
- Easy to lose or forget
- Vulnerable to phishing attacks
- Difficult to recover
- Poor user experience

Attesta solves this by using the same technology that powers modern authentication - **WebAuthn and passkeys**. The same technology that lets you unlock your phone with your face or fingerprint.
